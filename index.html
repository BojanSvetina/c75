        <p>Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

          <p>As someone who’s played every Uncharted game multiple times and gotten 100% completion in each of them, I can absolutely say that this was a fantastic movie adaptation of the series! Tom Holland hit all the right beats of Nathan’s personality. I was honestly a bit skeptical if he could do it at first, but he managed to bring Nate’s charm, wit, humor and heart in a way that was all his own. It really felt like it was Tom Holland’s Nathan Drake without it feeling like a cheap impression and I cannot wait to see more of him in the future! Mark Wahlberg did a pretty good job with Sully too and he did a nice job of showing off his seasoned, yet deeply caring personality. Sophia Ali also did a fantastic job with Chloe and all of the twists and turns of her character were handled perfectly! The remainder of the cast also did a pretty good job with their roles as well.

            In terms of the story, they really nailed that Uncharted feel. The globe-trotting, treasure hunting feel was persistent throughout the whole movie and it honestly felt like something out of the game. Even the slower moments of solving puzzles and unraveling the mystery of where to go next was translated surprisingly well! The action was also awesome! It had that high energy feel and I particularly like how they showed off Nate’s more improvisational side to his combat. As for the set pieces, they were incredible! The mix of old and new set pieces were really great to see and they really nailed the energy and intensity that you would traditionally feel if you were playing through them in the games.
            
            Overall, this was a fantastic movie adaptation that really captured the feel of the Uncharted games while still managing to be a fresh take of its own! Whether you’re a longtime fan of the series or you’re completely new to it, you’ll absolutely have fun with this movie! I really enjoyed it and I am so ready for the sequel!</p>
